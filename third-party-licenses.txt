## Introduction

The UI Toolkit is a component library for building web interfaces in Jupyter ecosystem (JupyterHub,
Jupyter Widgets, JupyterLab,...).

Features of the library include:

- **Implements the Jupyter design language:** All components follow the design language of Jupyter
  – enabling developers to create extensions that have a consistent look and feel with the rest of
  the ecosystem.
- **Automatic support for color themes:** All components are designed with theming in mind and will
  automatically display the current application theme.
- **Use any tech stack:** The library ships as a set of web components, meaning developers can use
  the toolkit no matter what tech stack (React, Vue, Svelte, etc.) their extension is built with.
- **Accessible out of the box:** All components ship with web standard compliant ARIA labels and
  keyboard navigation.

This repository contains three packages:

- [`@jupyter/web-components`](https://github.com/jupyterlab-contrib/jupyter-ui-toolkit/tree/main/packages/components/):
  The main package defining the web components.
- [`@jupyter/react-components`](https://github.com/jupyterlab-contrib/jupyter-ui-toolkit/tree/main/packages/react-components):
  Wrapped the web components to use them with [React](https://reactjs.org).
- [`jupyter-ui-demo`](https://github.com/jupyterlab-contrib/jupyter-ui-toolkit/tree/main/packages/lab-example):
  Unpublished JupyterLab extension to demonstrate the integration of the toolkit.

Those features are brought through the [Fast Design](https://www.fast.design/). And it is inspired
by the [WebView toolkit for Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-webview-ui-toolkit)
as example for creating a customized toolkit.

## Release

The UI Toolkit is currently in a proof of concept. Track progress towards 1.0 [here](https://github.com/jupyterlab-contrib/jupyter-ui-toolkit/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3Av1.0).
Styles and API are not guarantee between minor versions prior to v1.0.0.

## Getting started

You will need to install `yarn` (for example with `npm install --global yarn`).

To build the components packages, execute:

```sh
yarn install
yarn build
```

Then to interactively test or develop web components:

```sh
cd packages/components
yarn start
```

### JupyterLab demo extension

To test locally the JupyterLab demo extension, using `conda` package manager:

```sh
conda create -n jupyter-toolkit -c conda-forge -y nodejs yarn jupyterlab=3
conda activate jupyter-toolkit
yarn install
yarn build
pip install -e .
jupyter labextension develop --overwrite .
```

## Overview

This package introduces a number of concepts, such as session context, etc.
Here we give a brief overview of some of the top-level concepts in this
package.

### Clients

A _client_ is a single entity connected to a kernel. Since kernel messages
include the client id, it is easy for a client to filter kernel messages for
just messages between it and the kernel. In JupyterLab, different activities
(such as a console and a notebook) are usually considered separate clients when
connected to the same kernel.

### Kernel specs

A _kernel spec_ is the data about an available kernel on the system. We can
retrieve a current list of kernel specs from the server.

### Kernels

A _kernel_ represents a running process on the server that implements the
Jupyter kernel messaging protocol.

#### Kernel model

A _kernel model_ mirrors the server kernel models, and represents a single
running kernel on the server. A kernel can be created, restarted, shut down,
etc., through calls to the server. A kernel model's lifecycle mirrors the
server kernel model's lifecycle, and it will be disposed when the server
kernel is shut down.

#### Kernel connection

A _kernel connection_ represents a single client connecting to a kernel over a
websocket. Typically only one kernel connection handles comms for any given
kernel. The kernel connection is disposed when the client no longer has a need
for the connection. Disposing a kernel connection does not cause the kernel to
shut down. However, if a kernel is shut down, (eventually) all of its kernel
connections should be disposed if they were initiated from a kernel manager.
If the kernel connections were instantiated outside of a manager, you are
responsible for cleaning them up.

A kernel connection has a number of signals, such as kernel status, kernel
connection status, etc.

#### Kernel manager

A _kernel manager_ is an object that maintains a list of kernel models by
regular polling. The kernel manager can instantiate a kernel connection and
will manage its lifecycle (e.g., when the kernel is shut down, the connections
will be disposed). The manager provides some minimal bookkeeping around
kernels and their connections. Generally, it is easiest to interact with
kernels on a server through a manager.

### Sessions

A _session_ is a mapping on the server from an identifying string (the
session's `path`) to a kernel. A session has a few other pieces of information
to allow for easy categorization and searching of sessions.

The primary usecase of a session is to enable persisting a connection to a
kernel. For example, a notebook viewer may start a session with session path
of the notebook's file path. When a browser is refreshed, the notebook viewer
can connect to the same kernel by asking the server for the session
corresponding with the notebook file path.

#### Session model

A _session model_ mirrors a server session. The session models can be
refreshed from the server, created, changed (including creating a new session
kernel), and shut down (which implies that the kernel will be shut down). A
session model's lifecycle mirrors the server session's lifecycle, and it will
be disposed when the server session is shut down.

#### Session connection

A _session connection_ represents a single client connected to a session's
kernel. A session's kernel connection can change and may be null to signify no
current kernel connection. A session connection owns the kernel connection,
meaning the kernel connection is created and disposed by the session
connection as needed. The session connection proxies signals from the kernel
connection for convenience (e.g., you can listen to the session's status
signal to get status changes for whatever the current kernel is, without
having to disconnect and reconnect your signal handlers every time the session
kernel changes). The session connection can be disposed when the client no
longer is connected to that session's kernel, and disposal will not cause the
session model to be deleted.

#### Session manager

A _session manager_ is an object that maintains a list of session models by
regular polling. The session manager can instantiate a session connection and
will manage its lifecycle (e.g., when the session is shut down, the connections
will be disposed). The manager provides some minimal bookkeeping around
sessions and their connections. Generally, it is easiest to interact with
sessions on a server through a manager.

### Session Context

A _session context_ is an object which has the same lifecycle as the client.
The session context owns a session connection (which may be null if the client
is not currently associated with a session). The session context proxies the
current session connection's signals for convenience. The session context
primarily serves as a stable object for a client to keep track of the current
session connection. The session context also contains some convenience
functionality, such as preferences for whether a kernel should be started and
a user-friendly kernel name and status.

# @jupyterlab/ui-components

The
[@jupyterlab/ui-components](https://jupyterlab.github.io/jupyterlab/modules/_ui_components_src_index_.html)
package provides UI elements that are widely used in JupyterLab core,
and that can be reused in your own extensions.

For example, all of the icons in JupyterLab core can be reused via
`LabIcon`. You can also use `LabIcon` to create your own custom icons
that will be able to automatically change color to match the current
JupyterLab theme.

# `LabIcon` - set up and render icons

`LabIcon` is the icon class used by JupyterLab, and is part of the new
icon system introduced in JupyterLab v2.0.

## How JupyterLab handles icons

The @jupyterlab/ui-components package provides icons to the rest of
JupyterLab, in the form of a set of `LabIcon` instances (currently about
80). All of the icons in the core JupyterLab packages are rendered using
one of these `LabIcon` instances.

## Using the icons in your own code

You can use any of JupyterLab icons in your own code via an `import`
statement. For example, to use `jupyterIcon` you would first do:

```typescript
import { jupyterIcon } from '@jupyterlab/ui-components';
```

## How to render an icon into a DOM node

Icons can be added as children to any `div` or `span` nodes using the
`icon.element(...)` method (where `icon` is any instance of `LabIcon`).
For example, to render the Jupyter icon you could do:

```typescript
jupyterIcon.element({
  container: elem,
  height: '16px',
  width: '16px',
  marginLeft: '2px'
});
```

where `elem` is any `HTMLElement` with a `div` or `span` tag. As shown
in the above example, the icon can be styled by passing CSS parameters
into `.element(...)`. Any valid CSS parameter can be used (one catch:
snake case params do have to be converted to camel case: instead of
`foo-bar: '8px'`, you’d need to use `fooBar: '8px'`.

## How to render an icon as a React component

Icons can also be rendered using React. The `icon.react` parameter holds
a standard React component that will display the icon on render. Like
any React component, `icon.react` can be used in various ways.

For example, here is how you would add the Jupyter icon to the render
tree of another React component:

```jsx
public render() {
  return (
    <div className="outer">
      <div className="inner">
        <jupyterIcon.react tag="span" right="7px" top="5px" />
        "and here's a text node"
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Alternatively, you can just render the icon directly into any existing
DOM node `elem` by using the `ReactDOM` module:

```typescript
const root = createRoot(elem);
root.render(jupyterIcon.react);
```

If do you use `ReactDOM` to render, and if the `elem` node is ever
removed from the DOM, you’ll first need to clean it up:

```typescript
root.unmount();
```

This cleanup step is not a special property of `LabIcon`, but is instead
needed for any React component that is rendered directly at the top
level by `ReactDOM`.

## How to create your own custom `LabIcon`

You can create your own custom icon by constructing a new instance of
`LabIcon`:

```typescript
export const fooIcon = new LabIcon({
  name: 'barpkg:foo',
  svgstr: '<svg>...</svg>'
});
```

where `name` should be of the form “your-pkg:icon-name”, and `svgstr` is
the raw contents of your icon’s svg file.

## How to create a new `LabIcon` from an external svg file

Although you can copy-and-paste an svg directly into the `LabIcon`
constructor, the best practice is to keep the svg for each of your icons
in its own separate svg file. You will need to have an `svg.d.ts` file
at the root of your project’s `src` directory:

```typescript
// svg.d.ts

declare module '*.svg' {
  const value: string;
  export default value;
}
```

You can then `import` the contents of an svg file:

```typescript
import fooSvgstr from 'path-to-your/foo.svg';

export const fooIcon = new LabIcon({
  name: 'barpkg:foo',
  svgstr: fooSvgstr
});
```

## Sync icon color to JupyterLab theme

<em>Example svgs with class annotation can be found in <a href="https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/tree/f0153e0258b32674c9aec106383ddf7b618cebab/packages/ui-components/style/icons">ui-components/style/icons</a></em>

You can ensure that the colors of your custom `LabIcon` sync up to the
colors of the current JupyterLab theme by adding appropriate `class`
annotations to each colored element of your icon's svg.

In other words, each element of your svg that a `fill="..."` or a
`stroke="..."` property should also have a `class="jp-icon<whatever>"`
property.

### Available icon classes

<em>Icon-related CSS classes are defined in <a href="https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/blob/f0153e0258b32674c9aec106383ddf7b618cebab/packages/ui-components/style/icons.css">ui-components/style/icons.css</a></em>

All colors shown are for the standard light/dark theme, mouse over for
hex values.

#### `jp-iconX`: contrast to theme background

<ul>
<li>jp-icon0: <svg width="16" viewBox="0 0 1 1"><rect width="1" height="1" fill="#111"/><title>#111</title></svg> / <svg width="16" viewBox="0 0 1 1"><rect width="1" height="1" fill="#fff"/><title>#fff</title></svg></li>
<li>jp-icon1: <svg width="16" viewBox="0 0 1 1"><rect width="1" height="1" fill="#212121"/><title>#212121</title></svg> / <svg width="16" viewBox="0 0 1 1"><rect width="1" height="1" fill="#fff"/><title>#fff</title></svg></li>
<li>jp-icon2: <svg width="16" viewBox="0 0 1 1"><rect width="1" height="1" fill="#424242"/><title>#424242</title></svg> / <svg width="16" viewBox="0 0 1 1"><rect width="1" height="1" fill="#eee"/><title>#eee</title></svg></li>
<li>jp-icon3: <svg width="16" viewBox="0 0 1 1"><rect width="1" height="1" fill="#616161"/><title>#616161</title></svg> / <svg width="16" viewBox="0 0 1 1"><rect width="1" height="1" fill="#bdbdbd"/><title>#bdbdbd</title></svg></li>
<li>jp-icon4: <svg width="16" viewBox="0 0 1 1"><rect width="1" height="1" fill="#757575"/><title>#757575</title></svg> / <svg width="16" viewBox="0 0 1 1"><rect width="1" height="1" fill="#757575"/><title>#757575</title></svg></li>
</ul>

Most one-color icons in JupyterLab (including the sidebar and toolbar
icons) are colored using the `jp-icon3` class.

For light/dark themes, `jp-icon0` corresponds to the darkest/lightest
background color, while `jp-icon1` is somewhat lighter/darker, and so
forth.

#### `jp-icon-accentX`: match to theme background

<ul>
<li>jp-icon-accent0: <svg width="16" viewBox="0 0 1 1"><rect width="1" height="1" fill="#fff"/><title>#fff</title></svg> / <svg width="16" viewBox="0 0 1 1"><rect width="1" height="1" fill="#111"/><title>#111</title></svg></li>
<li>jp-icon-accent1: <svg width="16" viewBox="0 0 1 1"><rect width="1" height="1" fill="#fff"/><title>#fff</title></svg> / <svg width="16" viewBox="0 0 1 1"><rect width="1" height="1" fill="#212121"/><title>#212121</title></svg></li>
<li>jp-icon-accent2: <svg width="16" viewBox="0 0 1 1"><rect width="1" height="1" fill="#eee"/><title>#eee</title></svg> / <svg width="16" viewBox="0 0 1 1"><rect width="1" height="1" fill="#424242"/><title>#424242</title></svg></li>
<li>jp-icon-accent3: <svg width="16" viewBox="0 0 1 1"><rect width="1" height="1" fill="#bdbdbd"/><title>#bdbdbd</title></svg> / <svg width="16" viewBox="0 0 1 1"><rect width="1" height="1" fill="#616161"/><title>#616161</title></svg></li>
<li>jp-icon-accent4: <svg width="16" viewBox="0 0 1 1"><rect width="1" height="1" fill="#757575"/><title>#757575</title></svg> / <svg width="16" viewBox="0 0 1 1"><rect width="1" height="1" fill="#757575"/><title>#757575</title></svg></li>
</ul>

For light/dark themes, `jp-icon-accent0` corresponds to the
lightest/darkest background color, while `jp-icon-accent1` is somewhat
darker/lighter, and so forth.

### Adding classes to a one-color icon

For most simple, one-color icons, it is desirable for the icon's color
to strongly contrast with that of the application's background. You can
achieve this using one of the `jp-iconX` classes.

**Example: check icon**

_svg source:_

```html
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="100" viewBox="0 0 24 24">
  <path
    class="jp-icon3"
    fill="#616161"
    d="M9 16.17L4.83 12l-1.42 1.41L9 19 21 7l-1.41-1.41z"
  />
</svg>
```

_rendered icon:_

<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="100" viewBox="0 0 24 24">
  <path class="jp-icon3" fill="#616161" d="M9 16.17L4.83 12l-1.42 1.41L9 19 21 7l-1.41-1.41z"/>
</svg>

### Adding classes to a multi-colored icon

For more complex icons, each element that needs to match the background
should be annotated with a `jp-icon-accentX` class, while each element
that needs to contrast with the background should be annotated with a
`jp-iconX` class.

**Example: close-circle icon**

_svg source:_

```html
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="100" viewBox="0 0 24 24">
  <circle class="jp-icon3" fill="#616161" cx="12" cy="12" r="11" />
  <rect
    class="jp-icon-accent0"
    fill="#fff"
    height="18"
    width="2"
    x="11"
    y="3"
    transform="rotate(315, 12, 12)"
  />
  <rect
    class="jp-icon-accent0"
    fill="#fff"
    height="18"
    width="2"
    x="11"
    y="3"
    transform="rotate(45, 12, 12)"
  />
</svg>
```

_rendered icon:_

<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="100" viewBox="0 0 24 24">
  <circle class="jp-icon3" fill="#616161" cx="12" cy="12" r="11"/>
  <rect class="jp-icon-accent0" fill="#fff" height="18" width="2" x="11" y="3" transform="rotate(315, 12, 12)"/>
  <rect class="jp-icon-accent0" fill="#fff" height="18" width="2" x="11" y="3" transform="rotate(45, 12, 12)"/>
</svg>

## Background

### Icon handling in Jupyterlab

Pre JupyterLab 2.0, most icons were created using the
icons-as-css-background pattern:

- Set up the icon’s svg as a `background-image` in CSS:

  ```css
  /* CSS */

  .jp-FooIcon {
    background-image: url('path-to-your/foo.svg');
  }
  ```

- Add the icon to the DOM by constructing an otherwise empty DOM node
  with the appropriate class:

  ```typescript
  // typescript

  const e = document.createElement('div');
  e.className = 'jp-FooIcon';
  document.body.append(e);
  ```

What you end up with is a single DOM node that has the “foo” icon as a
background image.

Post JupyterLab 2.0, nearly all icons in core are now created using
[LabIcon](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/blob/f0153e0258b32674c9aec106383ddf7b618cebab/packages/ui-components/src/icon/labicon.tsx)
and the icons-as-inline-svg pattern:

- Construct a new instance of LabIcon from the icon’s name and svg:

  ```typescript
  // typescript

  // svgstr is the raw contents of an icon's svg file
  export const fooIcon = new LabIcon({
    name: 'barpkg:foo',
    svgstr: '<svg>...</svg>'
  });
  ```

- Add the icon to the DOM using the appropriate property of your
  LabIcon instance (either LabIcon.element() to directly create a DOM
  node, or LabIcon.react to get the icon as a react component):

  ```typescript
  // typescript

  const e = fooIcon.element();
  document.body.append(e);
  ```

What you end up with is a DOM node (by default a ‘div’) that has an
inline svg node as a child.

### `background-image` vs inline svg

The big limitation of the old icon-as-css-background pattern is that svg
images rendered as `background-image` are invisible to CSS. On the other
hand, an icon rendered as an inline svg node is fully exposed to the
CSS. This allows us to dynamically change icon styling as needed simply by
modifying our CSS. Most importantly, this allows us to recolor icons
according to Jupyterlab’s current theme.

The following npm package may be included in this product:

 - @lumino/polling@2.1.4

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# @lumino/polling

This package provides a class for generic polling functionality (`Poll`). It
also provides rate limiters (`Debouncer` and `Throttler`).

The `Poll` class provides three different ways to "subscribe" to poll ticks:

- [`@lumino/signaling`](../signaling/): `Poll#ticked` is a Lumino signal that
  emits each time there is a poll tick.
- `Promise`-based: `Poll#tick` is a promise that resolves after every tick and
  only rejects when the poll is disposed.
- `AsyncIterable`: `Poll#[`Symbol.asyncIterator`]` implements the async iterable
  protocol that allows iteration using [`for-await...of`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for-await...of) loops.

## Example usage

These are examples from the unit tests for this package. They
demonstrate the three different ways polling is supported.

### Using `Poll#tick` promise

Here, we set up the testing state variables and create a new `Poll` instance.

```typescript
const expected = 'started resolved resolved';
const ticker: IPoll.Phase<any>[] = [];
const tock = (poll: Poll) => {
  ticker.push(poll.state.phase);
  poll.tick.then(tock).catch(() => undefined);
};
const poll = new Poll({
  auto: false,
  factory: () => Promise.resolve(),
  frequency: { interval: 100, backoff: false }
});
```

Next we assign the `tock` function to run after the poll ticks and
we start the poll.

```typescript
void poll.tick.then(tock);
void poll.start();
```

And we verify that the `ticker` did indeed get populated when `tock`
was called and the next promise was captured as well.

```typescript
await sleep(1000); // Sleep for longer than the interval.
expect(ticker.join(' ').startsWith(expected)).to.equal(true);
poll.dispose();
```

### Using `Poll#ticked` signal

Here, we set up the testing state variables and create a new `Poll` instance.

```typescript
const poll = new Poll<void, void>({
  factory: () => Promise.resolve(),
  frequency: { interval: 100, backoff: false }
});
```

Here we connect to the `ticked` signal and simply check that each
tick matches the poll `state` accessor's contents.

```typescript
poll.ticked.connect((_, tick) => {
  expect(tick).to.equal(poll.state);
});
await sleep(1000); // Sleep for longer than the interval.
poll.dispose();
```

### Using `Poll` as an `AsyncIterable`

Here, we set up the testing state variables and create a new `Poll` instance.

```typescript
let poll: Poll;
let total = 2;
let i = 0;

poll = new Poll({
  auto: false,
  factory: () => Promise.resolve(++i > total ? poll.dispose() : void 0),
  frequency: { interval: Poll.IMMEDIATE }
});

const expected = `started${' resolved'.repeat(total)}`;
const ticker: IPoll.Phase<any>[] = [];
```

Then the poll is started:

```typescript
void poll.start();
```

Instead of connecting to the `ticked` signal or awaiting the `tick` promise, we can now use a `for-await...of` loop:

```typescript
for await (const state of poll) {
  ticker.push(state.phase);
  if (poll.isDisposed) {
    break;
  }
}
```

And we check to make sure the results are as expected:

```typescript
// ticker and expected both equal:
// 'started resolved resolved disposed'
expect(ticker.join(' ')).to.equal(expected);
```

### Note for consumers of async iterators

In order to use `for-await...of` loops in TypeScript, you will need to use `ES2018` or above in your `lib` array in `tsconfig.json`.

The markup above always references the latest release. When deploying to production, you will want to ship with a specific version. Here's an example of the markup for that:

```html
<script type="module" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@microsoft/fast-foundation@2.26.2/dist/fast-foundation.min.js"></script>
```

:::note
For simplicity, examples throughout the documentation will assume the library has been installed from NPM, but you can always replace the import location with the CDN URL.

The following npm package may be included in this product:

 - @microsoft/fast-web-utilities@5.4.1

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# FAST Web utilities

This package is a collection of utilities intended to be used for web projects.

## Installation

`npm i --save @microsoft/fast-web-utilities`

## Usage

### DOM utilities

#### getKeyCode

The `getKeyCode` function gets the numeric key code associated with a keyboard event. This method is for use with DOM level 3 events that still use the deprecated keyCode property.

```js
import { getKeyCode } from "@microsoft/fast-web-utilities";

handleKeyPress = (e) => {
    let keyCode = getKeyCode(e);

    // Do something based on keyCode value
}
```

### HTML utilities

#### getClientRectWithMargin

The `getClientRectWithMargin` function gets the client bounding rectangle including any margins of an element.

```js
import { getClientRectWithMargin } from "@microsoft/fast-web-utilities";

const itemWidth = getClientRectWithMargin(item).width;
const itemHeight = getClientRectWithMargin(item).height;
```

#### convertStylePropertyPixelsToNumber

The `convertStylePropertyPixelsToNumber` function will convert a property value from an elements computed style from pixels to a number value.

```js
import { convertStylePropertyPixelsToNumber } from "@microsoft/fast-web-utilities";

const elementTopMargin = convertStylePropertyPixelsToNumber(style, "margin-top");
```

### Key utilities

#### Key strings

Commonly used `event.key` values are available as individual exports. Additional `key` values will be added as needed.  

```js
import { keyEnter, keySpace } from "@microsoft/fast-web-utilities";

handleKeyPress = (e) => {
    switch (e.key) {
        case keySpace:
        case keyEnter:
            // Do something if key matches
            break;
    }
}
```

#### KeyCodes (enum)

Keycodes are deprecated and their use should be avoided. Use the individual string `key` values instead.

### Localization utilities

#### Typescript enum

The `Direction` enum contains the `ltr` and `rtl` enum for use in a Typescript project.

```typescript
import { Direction } from "@microsoft/fast-web-utilities";

let direction: Direction = Direction.ltr;
```

### Number utilities

#### Limit

The `limit` function ensures that a value is between a min and max value. If the value is lower than min, min will be returned. If the value is greater than max, max will be retured.

```js
import { limit } from "@microsoft/fast-web-utilities";
const incomingNumber; // 11 
const setNumberByLimit = limit(0, 10, incomingNumber); // returns 10
```

#### wrapInBounds

The `wrapInBounds` function keeps a given value within the bounds of a min and max value. If the value is larger than the max, the minimum value will be returned. If the value is smaller than the minimum, the maximum will be returned. Otherwise, the value is returned un-changed.

```js
import { wrapInBounds } from "@microsoft/fast-web-utilities";
const slides; // 5
const index; // 5
const activeIndex = wrapInBounds(0, this.slides.length - 1, index) // returns 0
```

### String utilities

#### Format

The `format` function builds a string from a format specifier and replacement parameters.

```js
import { format } from "@microsoft/fast-web-utilities";

const formatterString = "View {0} {1}";

const newString = format(formatterString, "page", "4")); // "View page 4"
```

#### startsWith

The `startsWith` function checks to see if one string starts with another. The function is case sensitive.

```js
import { startsWith } from "@microsoft/fast-web-utilities";

const matchIsFalse = startsWith("HelloWorld", "World"); // false
const matchIsTrue = startsWith("HelloWorld", "Hello"); // true
```

#### isNullOrWhiteSpace

The `isNullOrWhiteSpace` function determines if the specified string is undefined, null, empty, or whitespace. The function returns true if the value is undefined, null, empty, or whitespace, otherwise false.

```js
import { isNullOrWhiteSpace } from "@microsoft/fast-web-utilities";

const myAnchor = document.querySelector("#id");
const checkWhitespace = isNullOrWhiteSpace(myAnchor.href);
```

#### pascalCase

The `pascalCase` function converts a string to Pascal Case

```js
import { pascalCase } from "@microsoft/fast-web-utilities";

const hyphenatedToPascal = pascalCase("my-string");
const uppercaseToPascal = pascalCase("MY STRING");
const whitespaceToPascal = pascalCase(" my string ");
```

#### classNames
A utility for merging class names into a single string conditionally. Accepts any number of strings, functions that return strings and two index arrays where the first index is a string or function that returns a string, and the second index is a boolean.

```js
import { classNames } from "@microsoft/fast-web-utilities";

// evaluates to "classOne classTwo classThree classFive"
const myJoinedClassNames = classNames(
    "classOne",
    () => "classTwo",
    ["classThree", true],
    ["classFour", false]
    [() => "classFive", true],
    [() => "classSix", false]
)
```

    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
    copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
    publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
    Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

3.  Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

    (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
    use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
    where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
    by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
    Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
    with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
    institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
    or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
    or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
    granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
    as of the date such litigation is filed.

4.  Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
    Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
    modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
    meet the following conditions:

    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or

    excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
    the Derivative Works; and

    (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
    distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
    include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
    within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
    pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
    of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
    as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
    documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
    within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
    wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
    of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
    do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
    notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
    or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
    that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
    as modifying the License.

    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
    the conditions stated in this License.

5.  Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6.  Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,

    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7.  Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8.  Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9.  Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# json-schema-merge-allof [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mokkabonna/json-schema-merge-allof.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mokkabonna/json-schema-merge-allof) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/mokkabonna/json-schema-merge-allof/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/mokkabonna/json-schema-merge-allof?branch=master)

> Merge schemas combined using allOf into a more readable composed schema free from allOf.

```bash
npm install json-schema-merge-allof --save
```

## Features

- **Real** and **safe** merging of schemas combined with **allOf**
- Takes away all allOf found in the whole schema
- Lossless in terms of validation rules, merged schema does not validate more or less than the original schema
- Results in a more readable root schema
- Removes almost all logical impossibilities
- Throws if no logical intersection is found (your schema would not validate anything from the start)
- Validates in a way not possible by regular simple meta validators
- Correctly considers additionalProperties, patternProperties and properties as a part of an whole when merging schemas containing those
- Correctly considers items and additionalItems as a whole when merging schemas containing those
- Supports merging schemas with items as array and direct schema
- Supports merging dependencies when mixed array and schema
- Supports all JSON schema core/validation keywords (v6, use custom resolvers to support other keywords)
- Option to override common impossibility like adding properties when using **additionalProperties: false**
- Pluggable keyword resolvers

## How

Since allOf require ALL schemas provided (including the parent schema) to apply, we can iterate over all the schemas, extracting all the values for say, **type**, and find the **intersection** of valid values. Here is an example:

```js
{
  type: ['object', 'null'],
  additionalProperties: {
    type: 'string',
    minLength: 5
  },
  allOf: [{
    type: ['array', 'object'],
    additionalProperties: {
      type: 'string',
      minLength: 10,
      maxLength: 20
    }
  }]
}
```

This result in the schema :
```js
{
  type: 'object',
  additionalProperties: {
    type: 'string',
    minLength: 10,
    maxLength: 20
  }
}
```

Notice that type now excludes null and array since those are not logically possible. Also minLength is raised to 10. The other properties have no conflict and are merged into the root schema with no resolving needed.

For other keywords other methods are used, here are some simple examples:

- minLength, minimum, minItems etc chooses the **highest** value of the conflicting values.
- maxLength, maximum, maxItems etc chooses the **lowest** value of the conflicting values.
- uniqueItems is true if **any** of the conflicting values are true

As you can see above the strategy is to choose the **most** restrictive of the set of values that conflict. For some keywords that is done by intersection, for others like **required** it is done by a union of all the values, since that is the most restrictive.

What you are left with is a schema completely free of allOf. Except for in a couple of values that are impossible to properly intersect/combine:

### not

When multiple conflicting **not** values are found, we also use the approach that pattern use, but instead of allOf we use anyOf. When extraction of common rules from anyOf is in place this can be further simplified.

## Options
**ignoreAdditionalProperties** default **false**

Allows you to combine schema properties even though some schemas have `additionalProperties: false` This is the most common issue people face when trying to expand schemas using allOf and a limitation of the json schema spec. Be aware though that the schema produced will allow more than the original schema. But this is useful if just want to combine schemas using allOf as if additionalProperties wasn't false during the merge process. The resulting schema will still get additionalProperties set to false.

**deep** boolean, default *true*
If false, resolves only the top-level `allOf` keyword in the schema.

If true, resolves all `allOf` keywords in the schema.


**resolvers** Object
Override any default resolver like this:

```js
mergeAllOf(schema, {
  resolvers: {
    title: function(values, path, mergeSchemas, options) {
      // choose what title you want to be used based on the conflicting values
      // resolvers MUST return a value other than undefined
    }
  }
})
```

The function is passed:

- **values** an array of the conflicting values that need to be resolved
- **path** an array of strings containing the path to the position in the schema that caused the resolver to be called (useful if you use the same resolver for multiple keywords, or want to implement specific logic for custom paths)
- **mergeSchemas** a function you can call that merges an array of schemas
- **options** the options mergeAllOf was called with


### Combined resolvers
Some keyword are dependant on other keywords, like properties, patternProperties, additionalProperties. To create a resolver for these the resolver requires this structure:

```js
mergeAllOf(schema, {
  resolvers: {
    properties:
      keywords: ['properties', 'patternProperties', 'additionalProperties'],
      resolver(values, parents, mergers, options) {

      }
    }
  }
})
```

This type of resolvers are expected to return an object containing the resolved values of all the associated keywords. The keys must be the name of the keywords. So the properties resolver need to return an object like this containing the resolved values for each keyword:

```js
{
    properties: ...,
    patternProperties: ...,
    additionalProperties: ...,
}
```

Also the resolve function is not passed **mergeSchemas**, but an object **mergers** that contains mergers for each of the related keywords. So properties get passed an object like this:

```js
const mergers = {
    properties: function mergeSchemas(schemas, childSchemaName){...},
    patternProperties: function mergeSchemas(schemas, childSchemaName){...},
    additionalProperties: function mergeSchemas(schemas){...},
}
```

Some of the mergers requires you to supply a string of the name or index of the subschema you are currently merging. This is to make sure the path passed to child resolvers are correct.

### Default resolver
You can set a default resolver that catches any unknown keyword. Let's say you want to use the same strategy as the ones for the meta keywords, to use the first value found. You can accomplish that like this:

```js
mergeJsonSchema({
  ...
}, {
  resolvers: {
    defaultResolver: mergeJsonSchema.options.resolvers.title
  }
})
```


## Resolvers

Resolvers are called whenever multiple conflicting values are found on the same position in the schemas.

You can override a resolver by supplying it in the options.

### Lossy vs lossless

All built in reducers for validation keywords are lossless, meaning that they don't remove or add anything in terms of validation.

For meta keywords like title, description, $id, $schema, default the strategy is to use the first possible value if there are conflicting ones. So the root schema is prioritized. This process possibly removes some meta information from your schema. So it's lossy. Override this by providing custom resolvers.


## $ref

If one of your schemas contain a $ref property you should resolve them using a ref resolver like [json-schema-ref-parser](https://github.com/BigstickCarpet/json-schema-ref-parser) to dereference your schema for you first. Resolving $refs is not the task of this library.


## Other libraries

There exists some libraries that claim to merge schemas combined with allOf, but they just merge schemas using a **very** basic logic. Basically just the same as lodash merge. So you risk ending up with a schema that allows more or less than the original schema would allow.


## Restrictions

We cannot merge schemas that are a logical impossibility, like:

```js
{
  type: 'object',
  allOf: [{
    type: 'array'
  }]
}
```

The library will then throw an error reporting the values that had no valid intersection. But then again, your original schema wouldn't validate anything either.


## Roadmap

- [x] Treat the interdependent validations like properties and additionalProperties as one resolver (and items additionalItems)
- [ ] Extract repeating validators from anyOf/oneOf and merge them with parent schema
- [ ] After extraction of validators from anyOf/oneOf, compare them and remove duplicates.
- [ ] If left with only one in anyOf/oneOf then merge it to the parent schema.
- [ ] Expose seperate tools for validation, extraction
- [ ] Consider adding even more logical validation (like minLength <= maxLength)

## Contributing

Create tests for new functionality and follow the eslint rules.
